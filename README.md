# dotfiles

Personal dotfiles, managed with GNU stow
- OS: macOS
- WM: Aerospace
- Editor: neovim
- Terminal: Wezterm
- Font: Iosevka Extended
- Theme: Rose pine

Notes:
- I use every app maximized, almost never tile
- I have every macOS trackpad navigation gesture disabled as they conflict with aerospace
- Neovim runs on the nightly branch, which now includes a OOTB package manager
